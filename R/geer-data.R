#' One hundred nine adults aged 18â€“55 with pre-existing dental plaque but without

#' clinical trial. Subjects were assigned to one of two novel mouth rinses (A or B)
#' or to a control mouth rinse. Eligibility required at least 20 sound natural teeth
#' and a mean plaque index of 2.0 or greater; subjects with gross oral pathology or
#' recent antibiotic, antibacterial, or anti-inflammatory therapy were excluded.
#' Plaque was assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months using the Turesky
#' modification of the Quigley-Hein index. Four subjects had missing plaque scores.
#' The trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the three rinses in inhibiting
#' dental plaque.
