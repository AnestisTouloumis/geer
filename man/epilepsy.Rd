A total of 57 patients with partial seizures were enrolled in a randomized
clinical trial. Patients were allocated to either the anti-epileptic drug
progabide or to placebo. Prior to receiving treatment,
the number of epileptic seizures during the preceding 8-week interval were
recorded. After receiving treatment, the number of epileptic seizures were
recorded at each of four 2-week intervals clinic visits.
