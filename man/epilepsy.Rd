\title{Seizure counts for 59 epileptics}
\format{
A data frame with 295 rows and 5 columns:
\describe{
  \item{id}{a factor with 59 levels}
  \item{treatment}{a factor with levels placebo and progabide}
  \item{age}{a numeric vector}
  \item{week}{a numeric vector; 0 represents the baseline over the
  preceeding 8 weeks}
  \item{nSeizures}{a numeric vector; number of seizures}
  \item{response}{a factor indicating if the subject had 5 or less seisures.}
  }

\usage{
epilepsy
}
\description{
The data are from a placebo-controlled clinical trial of 59 epileptics.
Patients with partial seizures were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial
of the anti-epileptic drug, progabide.
}
\details{
Participants in the study were randomized to either progabide or a placebo,
as an adjuvant to the standard anti-epileptic chemotherapy. Progabide is an
anti-epileptic drug whose primary mechanism of action is to enhance
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content; GABA is the primary inhibitory
neurotransmitter in the brain. Prior to receiving treatment, baseline data
on the number of epileptic seizures during the preceding 8-week interval were
recorded. Counts of epileptic seizures during 2-week intervals before each of
four successive post-randomization clinic visits were recorded.
