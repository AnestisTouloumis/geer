\description{
The data are from a randomized clinical trial on the efficacy of progabide in
treating partial seizures.
}
\details{
Fifty-nine subjects with partial seizures were enrolled in a randomized clinical
trial. Subjects were assigned to receive either the anti-epileptic drug progabide
or placebo. Seizure counts were recorded during the 8 weeks prior to treatment.
After treatment, seizure counts were assessed at four 2-week clinic visits.
