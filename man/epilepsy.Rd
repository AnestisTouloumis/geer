\description{
The data are from a clinical trial on epilepsy.

\details{
A total of 59 subjects with partial seizures were enrolled in a randomized
clinical trial. Subjects were allocated to either the anti-epileptic drug
progabide or to placebo. Prior to receiving treatment, the number of epileptic
seizures during the preceding 8-week interval were recorded. After receiving
treatment, the number of epileptic seizures were recorded at each of four
2-week intervals clinic visits.
