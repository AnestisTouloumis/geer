\usage{
step_model_selection_p(
  object,
  scope,
  test = "score",

  p_enter = 0.2,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object representing a model of the appropriate class
\code{geer}. This is used as the initial model in the stepwise search.}

\item{scope}{defines the range of models examined in the stepwise search. This
should be either a single formula, or a list containing components upper and
lower, both formulae. See the details for how to specify the formulae and how
they are used.}

\item{test}{character indicating the hypothesis testing procedure applied.
Options include \code{wald} or \code{score} test.  By
default, the wald test is used.}

\item{cov_type}{character indicating whether the sandwich (robust)
covariance
matrix (\code{cov_type = "robust"}), the model-based (naive) covariance
matrix (\code{cov_type = "naive"}), the bias-corrected covariance
matrix (\code{cov_type = "bias-corrected"}) or the degrees of freedom adjusted
covariance matrix (\code{cov_type = "df-adjusted"}) should be used. By
default, the robust covariance matrix is used.}

\item{p_enter}{numeric between 0 and 1 indicating the p-value threshold for
adding variables in the stepwise search.}

\item{p_remove}{numeric between 0 and 1 indicating the p-value threshold for
removing variables in the stepwise search.}

\item{direction}{the mode of stepwise search, can be one of \code{"both"},
\code{"backward"}, or \code{"forward"}, with a default of \code{"forward"}. If
the scope argument is missing the default for direction is \code{"backward"}.}

\item{steps}{the maximum number of steps to be considered. The default is 1000
(essentially as many as required). It is typically used to stop the process
early.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
