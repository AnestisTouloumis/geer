\arguments{
\item{object}{an object representing a model of the class \code{geer}. This is
used as the initial model in the stepwise search.}

\item{scope}{
    defines the range of models examined in the stepwise search.
    This should be either a single formula, or a list containing
    components \code{upper} and \code{lower}, both formulae.  See the
    details for how to specify the formulae and how they are used.
  }

\item{direction}{
    the mode of stepwise search, can be one of \code{"both"},
    \code{"backward"}, or \code{"forward"}, with a default of \code{"both"}.
    If the \code{scope} argument is missing the default for
    \code{direction} is \code{"backward"}.  Values can be abbreviated.
  }

\item{test}{character indicating the desired test. Options include the
Wald test (\code{"wald"}), the generalized score test
(\code{"score"}), the modified working Wald test
(\code{"working-wald"}), the modified working score test
(\code{"working-score"}) and the modified working likelihood
ratio test (\code{"working-lrt"}). By default, the
Wald test is performed.}

\item{cov_type}{character indicating the type of the covariance matrix to be
used. Options include the sandwich or robust covariance
matrix (\code{"robust"}), the bias-corrected covariance
matrix (\code{"bias-corrected"}), the degrees of freedom adjusted
covariance matrix (\code{"df-adjusted"}) and the model-based or naive
covariance matrix (\code{"naive"}). By default, the robust covariance
matrix is used.}

\item{pmethod}{character indicating the method used to approximate the p-value
when the modified working Wald test, the modified working score test or
the modified working likelihood ratio test is used. Options include the
Rao-Scott approximation (\code{"rao-scott"}) and the Satterthwaite
approximation (\code{"Satterthwaite"}). By default, the Rao-Scott
approximation is used.}

\item{p_enter}{numeric between 0 and 1 indicating the p-value threshold for
adding variables in the stepwise search.}

\item{p_remove}{numeric between 0 and 1 indicating the p-value threshold for
removing variables in the stepwise search.}

\item{steps}{
    the maximum number of steps to be considered.  The default is 1000
    (essentially as many as required).  It is typically used to stop the
    process early.
  }

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
