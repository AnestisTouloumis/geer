\details{
A total of 41 subjects were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of shoulder
pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Subjects were allocated to either
the active group (with abdominal suction) or to the placebo group (without
abdominal suction). After the operation, subjects were asked to rate their
shoulder pain in six occasions (morning and afternoon for three days after
the operation).
