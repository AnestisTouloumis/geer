The data are from a clinical trial of patients with shoulder pain after

\details{
A total of 41 patients were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of shoulder
pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients were allocated to either
the active group (with abdominal suction) or to the placebo group (without
abdominal suction). After the operation, patients were asked to rate their
shoulder pain in six occasions (morning and afternoon for three days after
the operation).
