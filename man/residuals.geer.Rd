\title{EResiduals from a \code{geer} Object}
\usage{
\method{residuals}{geer}(object, type = c("working", "pearson", "deviance"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object representing a model of the class \code{geer}.}

\item{type}{character indicating whether the type of the residuals to return.
Options include the working residuals (\code{"working"}), the pearson
residuals (\code{"pearson"}) and the deviance residuals
(\code{"deviance"}). By default, the working residuals are returned.}

\item{...}{additional argument(s) passed to methods.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of residuals of the requested \code{type}.
}
\description{
Extract residuals of different types from a fitted \code{geer} object.
}
\details{
The residuals are computed according to the marginal distribution specified
by \code{object$family$family}.

\itemize{
  \item Working residuals: raw differences between observed and fitted values.
  \item Pearson residuals: standardized by the variance function of the
        specified family.
  \item Deviance residuals: signed square roots of the contribution of each
        observation to the model deviance.
