\title{Extract Model Residuals from a \code{geer} Object}
\usage{
\method{residuals}{geer}(object, type = c("working", "pearson", "deviance"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object representing a model of the class \code{geer}.}

\item{type}{character indicating whether the type of the residuals to be
returned. Options include the working residuals (\code{"working"}),
the pearson residuals (\code{"pearson"}) and the deviance residuals
(\code{"deviance"}). By default, the working residuals are returned.}

\item{...}{additional argument(s) for methods.}
}
\value{
A vector with the observed residuals type \code{type}.
}
\description{
Extract residuals from a fitted model.
}
\details{
If \code{type = "working"}, then the raw residuals (\code{observed - fitted})
are returned.

If \code{type = "pearson"}, then the pearson residuals are returned. The
marginal distribution of the responses is defined by \code{object$family$family}.

If \code{type = "deviance"}, then the deviance residuals are returned. The
marginal distribution of the responses is defined by \code{object$family$family}.
