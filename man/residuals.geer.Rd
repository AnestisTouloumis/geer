\usage{
\method{residuals}{geer}(object, type = "working", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a fitted model \code{geer} object.}

\item{type}{character indicating whether the type of the residuals to be
returned. Options include the working residuals (\code{type =
"working"}), the pearson residuals (\code{type = "pearson"}) and
the deviance residuals (\code{type = "deviance"}). By default, the
\code{"working"} residuals are returned.}

\item{...}{other arguments.}
}
\value{
A vector with the observed residuals type \code{type}.
}
\description{
Extract model residuals from \code{geer} objects.
}
\details{
If \code{type = "working"}, then the raw residuals (\code{observed - fitted})
are returned.

If \code{type = "pearson"}, then the pearson residuals are returned. The
marginal distribution of the responses is defined by \code{object$family}.

If \code{type = "deviance"}, then the deviance residuals are returned. The
marginal distribution of the responses is defined by \code{object$family}.
