\title{Extract model residuals from \code{geer} objects}
\usage{
\method{residuals}{geer}(object, type = c("working", "pearson", "deviance"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a `geer` object.}

\item{type}{the type of residuals which should be returned. The alternatives are:
"working", "deviance" and "pearson". Can be abbreviated.}

\item{...}{other arguments.}
}
\value{
A vector with the observed residuals type `type`.
}
\description{
Extract model residuals from \code{geer} objects.
}
\details{
If \code{type = "working"}, then the raw residuals will be returned.

If \code{type = "pearson"}, then the pearson residuals will be returned. The
marginal distribution of the responses will be defined by the `object`.

If \code{type = "deviance"}, then the deviance residuals will be returned. The
marginal distribution of the responses will be defined by the `object`.
