The dataset consists of safety data from a crossover trial on cerebrovascular deficiency.
}
\details{
The response variable is not a trial endpoint but rather a potential side
effect, indicating whether an electrocardiogram (ECG) was abnormal or normal.
This two-period crossover trial compares the effects of active drug to placebo.
The 67 patients were randomly allocated to the two treatment sequences, with
34 patients receiving placebo followed by active treatment, and 33 patients
receiving active treatment followed by placebo.
