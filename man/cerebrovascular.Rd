\title{Two-period crossover trial study on cerebrovascular deficiency}
\format{
A data frame with 134 rows and 4 columns:
\describe{
  \item{id}{a factor with 67 levels}
  \item{period}{a factor with levels 1 and 2}
  \item{ecg}{a factor (ECG response) with levels normal and abnormal}
  \item{treatment}{a factor with levels placebo and active}
  }
}
\usage{
cerebrovascular
}
\description{
The dataset consists of safety data from a crossover trial on the disease
cerebrovascular deficiency.
}
\details{
The response variable is not a trial endpoint but rather a potential side
effect. In this two-period crossover trial, comparing the effects of active
drug to placebo, 67 patients were randomly allocated to the two treatment
sequences, with 34 patients receiving placebo followed by active treatment,
and 33 patients receiving active treatment followed by placebo. The response
variable is binary, indicating whether an electrocardiogram (ECG) was
abnormal (1) or normal (0). Each patient has a bivariate binary response
vector.
