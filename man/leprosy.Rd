}
\details{
A total of 30 patients were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial in
Philippines. Prior to receiving treatment, the number of leprosy bacilli at
six sites of the body were recorded. After receiving treatment (A, B or C),
the number of leprosy bacilli were recorded again. The respiratory status
was determined at the baseline and at each of the four follow-up visits. One
of the goals of this study is whether treatment with antibiotics
(treatments A and B) reduces the abundance of leprosy bacilli at the six sites
of the body when compared to placebo (treatment C).
