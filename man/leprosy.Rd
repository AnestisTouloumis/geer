\details{
Thirty subjects in the Philippines were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial.
Subjects were assigned to receive treatment A, B, or C. Before treatment, the
number of leprosy bacilli at six body sites was recorded. After treatment, bacilli
counts were recorded again, and respiratory status was assessed at baseline and at
four follow-up visits. The trial aimed to test whether antibiotic treatments A and B
reduced bacilli abundance compared with placebo (treatment C).
