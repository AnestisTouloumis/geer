\title{Generalized Score Test of Nested GEE Models}
\usage{
score_test(object0, object1, type = "robust")
}
\arguments{
\item{object0}{A fitted model of the class \code{geer}.}

\item{object1}{A fitted model of the class \code{geer}.}

\item{type}{character indicating whether the sandwich (robust) covariance matrix (\code{type = "robust"}), the model-based (naive) covariance matrix (\code{type = "naive"}) or the bias-corrected covariance matrix (\code{type = "bias_corrected"}) should be employed in the calculation of the test statistic.}
}
\description{
Comparing two nested GEE models by carrying out a generalized score test.
}
\details{
The two GEE models implied by \code{object0} and \code{object1} must be
nested.
