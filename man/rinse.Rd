\description{
The data are from a randomized clinical trial on the efficacy of mouth rinses in
reducing dental plaque.

\details{
One hundred nine adults aged 18â€“55 with pre-existing dental plaque but without
advanced periodontal disease were enrolled in a randomized, double-blinded
clinical trial. Subjects were assigned to one of two novel mouth rinses (A or B)
or to a control mouth rinse. Eligibility required at least 20 sound natural teeth
and a mean plaque index of 2.0 or greater; subjects with gross oral pathology or
recent antibiotic, antibacterial, or anti-inflammatory therapy were excluded.
Plaque was assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months using the Turesky
modification of the Quigley-Hein index. Four subjects had missing plaque scores.
The trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the three rinses in inhibiting
dental plaque.
