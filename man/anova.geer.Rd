\usage{
\method{anova}{geer}(
  object,
  ...,
  test = c("wald", "score", "working-wald", "working-score", "working-lrt"),
  cov_type = c("robust", "bias-corrected", "df-adjusted", "naive"),
  pmethod = c("rao-scott", "satterthwaite")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object representing a model of the class \code{geer}.}

\item{...}{additional objects representing models of the same class \code{geer}.}

\item{test}{character indicating the hypothesis testing procedure. Options
include the Wald test (\code{"wald"}), the generalized score test
(\code{"score"}), the modified working Wald test
(\code{"working-wald"}), the modified working score test
(\code{"working-score"}) and the modified working likelihood ratio
test (\code{"working-lrt"}). Defaults to \code{"wald"}.}

\item{cov_type}{character indicating the covariance matrix estimator
of the regression parameters. Options include the sandwich or
robust estimator (\code{"robust"}), the bias-corrected estimator
(\code{"bias-corrected"}), the degrees of freedom adjusted estimator
(\code{"df-adjusted"}) and the model-based or naive estimator
(\code{"naive"}). Defaults to \code{"robust"}.}

\item{pmethod}{character indicating the method used to approximate the
p-value when one of the modified working tests is selected. Options
include the Raoâ€“Scott approximation (\code{"rao-scott"}) and the
Satterthwaite approximation (\code{"satterthwaite"}). Defaults to
\code{"rao-scott"}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{anova}, representing an analysis-of-variance table
within the GEE framework.

\itemize{
  \item With a single model, the table reports the significance of each model
  term.
  \item With multiple models, the table reports sequential tests comparing
  each model to the previous one.
}
}
\description{
Compute analysis of variance (ANOVA) tables for one or more fitted models of
class \code{geer}, using a variety of hypothesis testing procedures.
}
\details{
Details of the hypothesis tests controlled by \code{test} are given in
\cite{Rotnitzky and Jewell (1990)}. The option \code{test = "working-lrt"}
is valid only when the model is fitted with an \emph{independence} working
correlation structure; otherwise an error is returned.

When \code{test \%in\% c("wald", "score")}, the \code{pmethod} argument is
ignored. In this case, \code{cov_type} specifies the covariance estimator
used in the test statistic. For other tests, \code{cov_type} determines the
covariance matrix used to form the coefficients of the sum of independent
chi-squared random variables, and \code{p_method} specifies the approximation
used to compute the p-value.

When comparing two or more models, the data must be identical across all
fits, and the models must be nested in the order supplied. In particular,
each consecutive pair of models must be nested.
