\title{ANOVA Tables for \code{geer} Objects}
\usage{
\method{anova}{geer}(object, ..., test = "wald", cov_type = "robust", pmethod = "rao-scott")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object representing a model of the class \code{geer}.}

\item{...}{additional objects representing models of the same class \code{geer}.}

\item{test}{character indicating the desired test. Options include the
Wald test (\code{"wald"}), the generalized score test
(\code{"score"}), the modified working Wald test
(\code{"working-wald"}), the modified working score test
(\code{"working-score"}) and the modified working likelihood
ratio test (\code{"working-lrt"}). By default, the
Wald test is performed.}

\item{cov_type}{character indicating the type of the covariance matrix to be
used. Options include the sandwich or robust covariance
matrix (\code{"robust"}), the bias-corrected covariance
matrix (\code{"bias-corrected"}), the degrees of freedom adjusted
covariance matrix (\code{"df-adjusted"}) and the model-based or naive
covariance matrix (\code{"naive"}). By default, the robust covariance
matrix is used.}

\item{pmethod}{character indicating the method used to approximate the p-value
when the modified working Wald test, the modified working score test or
the modified working likelihood ratio test is used. Options include the
Rao-Scott approximation (\code{"rao-scott"}) and the Satterthwaite
approximation (\code{"Satterthwaite"}). By default, the Rao-Scott
approximation is used.}
}
\value{
This function returns an object of class \code{anova}. These objects represent
analysis-of-variance tables within the GEE framework.

When given a single argument, \code{anova} produces a table which tests whether the model
terms are significant. When given a sequence of objects, \code{anova} tests the models
against one another in the order specified. This requires that two consecutive models
are nested.
}
\description{
Compute analysis of variance tables using hypothesis testing procedures for
one or more fitted model.
}
\details{
If \code{test = "wald"}, then the Wald test is applied. This test statistic is
based on the asymptotic normality of the regression estimates, see
\cite{Liang and Zeger (1986)}.

If \code{test = "score"}, then the generalized score test is applied, see
\cite{Rotnitzky and Jewell (1990)} and \cite{Boos (1992)}.

If \code{test = "working-wald"}, then the modified working Wald test is
applied, see \cite{Rotnitzky and Jewell (1990)}.

If \code{test = "working-score"}, then the modified working score test is applied,
see \cite{Rotnitzky and Jewell (1990)}.

If \code{test = "working-lrt"}, then the modified working likelihood ratio test
is applied, see \cite{Rotnitzky and Jewell (1990)}. This testing procedure is
only available when the working association structure is the independence.
Otherwise, an error message is returned.

For the Wald and the generalized score test, \code{cov_type} specifies the covariance
matrix estimate of the estimated regression parameters used to calculate the
corresponding test statistic. For the modified working Wald, score and likelihood
ratio tests, \code{cov_type} specifies the covariance matrix estimate of the
estimated regression parameters used to calculate the coefficients of the
independent chi-squared random variables.

For the Wald and Generalized Score tests, \code{pmethod} is ignored. Both
methods for approximating the p-value of the modified working testing
procedures can be found in \cite{Rotnitzky and Jewell (1990)}.
