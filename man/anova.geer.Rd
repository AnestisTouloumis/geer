\usage{
\method{anova}{geer}(object, ..., test = "wald", cov_type = "robust", pmethod = "rao-scott")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object containing the results returned by a model fitting
function the class \code{geer}.}

\item{...}{additional objects of the same class \code{geer}.}

\item{test}{character indicating the desired test. Options include the
Wald test (\code{test = "wald"}), the generalized score test
(\code{test = "score"}), the modified working Wald test
(\code{test = "working-wald"}), the modified working score test
(\code{test = "working-score"}) and the modified working likelihood
ratio test (\code{test = "working-lrt"}). By default, the
Wald test is performed.}

\item{cov_type}{character indicating the type of the covariance matrix to be
used in the test statistics. Options include the sandwich (robust) covariance
matrix (\code{cov_type = "robust"}), the model-based (naive) covariance
matrix (\code{cov_type = "naive"}), the bias-corrected covariance
matrix (\code{cov_type = "bias-corrected"}) and the degrees of freedom adjusted
covariance matrix (\code{cov_type = "df-adjusted"}). By default, the
robust covariance matrix is used.}

\item{pmethod}{character indicating the method used to approximate the p-value when
when the modified working Wald test, the modified working score test or
the modified working likelihood ratio test is used. Options include the
Rao-Scott approximation (\code{pmethod = "rao-scott"}) and the
Satterthwaite approximation (\code{pmethod = "Satterthwaite"}).}
}
\value{
This function returns an object of class \code{anova}. These objects represent
analysis-of-variance and analysis-of-deviance tables in the GEE framework.

When given a single argument it produces a table which tests whether the model
terms are significant. When given a sequence of objects, anova tests the models
against one another in the order specified.
}
\description{
Compute analysis of variance tables for one or more fitted model objects.
}
\details{
If \code{test = "wald"}, then the Wald test is applied. This is based on the
asymptotic normality of the regression estimates, see \cite{Liang and Zeger (1986)}.

If \code{test = "score"}, then the generalized score test is applied, see
\cite{Rotnitzky and Jewell (1990)} and \cite{Boos (1992)}.

If \code{test = "working-wald"}, then the modified working Wald test is
applied, see \cite{Rotnitzky and Jewell (1990)}.

If \code{test = "working-score"}, then the modified working score test is applied,
see \cite{Rotnitzky and Jewell (1990)}.

If \code{test = "working-lrt"}, then the modified working likelihood ratio test
is applied, see \cite{Rotnitzky and Jewell (1990)}. This testing procedure is
only available when the working assocation structure is the independence.
Otherwise, an error message is returned.

For the Wald and Generalized Score tests, \code{cov_type} specifies the covariance
matrix estimate of the estimated regression parameters used to calculate the
corresponding test statistics. For the modified working Wald, score and likelihood
ratio tests, \code{cov_type} specifies the covariance matrix estimate of the
estimated regression parameters used to obtain the asymptotic distribution of
the corresponding test statistics.

For the Wald and Generalized Score tests, \code{pmethod} is ignored. Both methods
for approximating the p-value of the modified working testing procedures can be found
in \cite{Rotnitzky and Jewell (1990)}.
