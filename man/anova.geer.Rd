\usage{
\method{anova}{geer}(
  object,
  ...,
  test = c("wald", "score", "working-wald", "working-score", "working-lrt"),
  cov_type = c("robust", "bias-corrected", "df-adjusted", "naive"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object representing a model of the class \code{geer}.}

\item{...}{additional objects representing models of the same class \code{geer}.}

\item{test}{character indicating the hypothesis testing procedure. Options
include the Wald test (\code{"wald"}), the generalized score test
(\code{"score"}), the modified working Wald test
(\code{"working-wald"}), the modified working score test
(\code{"working-score"}) and the modified working likelihood ratio
test (\code{"working-lrt"}). By default, the Wald test is performed.}

\item{cov_type}{character indicating the type of the covariance matrix to be
used in the testing procedure. Options include the sandwich or robust
covariance matrix (\code{"robust"}), the bias-corrected covariance
matrix (\code{"bias-corrected"}), the degrees of freedom adjusted
covariance matrix (\code{"df-adjusted"}) and the model-based or naive
covariance matrix (\code{"naive"}). By default, the robust covariance
matrix is used.}

\item{pmethod}{character indicating the method used to approximate the p-value
when the modified working Wald test, the modified working score test or
the modified working likelihood ratio test is selected. Options include
the Rao-Scott approximation (\code{"rao-scott"}) and the Satterthwaite
approximation (\code{"Satterthwaite"}). By default, the Rao-Scott
approximation is used.}
}
\value{
This function returns an object of class \code{anova}. These objects represent
analysis-of-variance tables within the GEE framework.

When given a single argument, \code{anova} produces a table which tests
whether the model terms are significant. When given a sequence of objects,
\code{anova} tests the models against one another in the order specified.
This requires that two consecutive models are nested.
}
\description{
Compute analysis of variance tables using hypothesis testing procedures for
one or more fitted model.
}
\details{
Details about the hypothesis testing procedures implied by \code{test} can
be found in \cite{Rotnitzky and Jewell (1990)}. Note that
\code{test = "working-lrt"} is only available to fitted models with an
independence working association structure. Otherwise, an error message is
returned.

When \code{test = "wald"} or \code{test = "score"}, the \code{p_method}
argument is ignored and \code{cov_type} specifies the covariance matrix
estimate used to calculate the corresponding test statistic. Otherwise,
\code{cov_type} specifies the covariance matrix estimate used to calculate
the coefficients of the sum of independent chi-squared random variables, and
\code{p_method} argument specifies the approximation method used to calculate
the p-value of the resulting test statistic.

The comparison between two or more models will only be valid if they are
fitted to the same dataset.
