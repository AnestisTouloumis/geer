\title{Obesity Study}
\format{
A data frame with 195 rows and 7 columns:
\describe{
  \item{fid}{Family identifier.}
  \item{sid}{Individual identifier.}
  \item{obesity}{Obesity status with three levels: Lean, Obese and
  Overweight.}
  \item{age}{Age in years.}
  \item{zygosity}{Zygocity identifier with two levels: monozygotic (MZ) or
  dizygotic (DZ).}
  \item{ancestry}{Ancestry identifier with two levels: European (EA) or
  African (AA).}
  \item{bacteroides}{the abundance of bacteroides.}

\description{
The data are from the Missouri Adolescent Female Twin Study.
}
\details{
The data were collected from 54 families with adult female twin pairs born
in Missouri. The obesity category for each individual was recorded as Obese
(BMI > 29), lean (BMI < 25) or overweight (25 < BMI < 30). One of the aims of
 the study was to understand the relationship between obesity and gut microbiome.
 Individual RNA samples were obtained at the baseline and at most at one
 follow up time and the abundance of several microbiomes was measured
 using RNA sequencing. This dataset is a subset of the original dataset that
 includes only the abundance of Bacteroides. In addition, the age, the
 zygocity and the ancestry of each twin were recorded.
