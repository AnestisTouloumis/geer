The data are from the Missouri Adolescent Female Twin Study.

The data are from a clinical trial of patients with leprosy.

\details{
The data were collected from 54 families with adult female twin pairs born
in Missouri. The obesity category for each individual was recorded as Obese
(BMI > 29), lean (BMI < 25) or overweight (25 < BMI < 30). One of the aims of
 the study was to understand the relationship between obesity and gut microbiome.
 Individual RNA samples were obtained at the baseline and at most at one
 follow up time and the abundance of several microbiomes was measured
 using RNA sequencing. This dataset is a subset of the original dataset that
 includes only the abundance of Bacteroides. In addition, the age, the
 zygocity and the ancestry of each twin were recorded.

A total of 30 patients were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial in
Philippines. Prior to receiving treatment, the number of leprosy bacilli at
six sites of the body were recorded. After receiving treatment (A, B or C),
the number of leprosy bacilli were recorded again. The respiratory status
was determined at the baseline and at each of the four follow-up visits. One
of the goals of this study is whether treatment with antibiotics
(treatments A and B) reduces the abundance of leprosy bacilli at the six sites
of the body when compared to placebo (treatment C).
