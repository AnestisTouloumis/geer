\title{Add or Drop All Possible Single Terms to a Model from a \code{geer} Object}
\usage{
\method{add1}{geer}(
  object,
  scope,
  test = "wald",
  cov_type = "robust",
  pmethod = "rao-scott",
  ...
)

\method{drop1}{geer}(
  object,
  scope,
  test = "wald",
  cov_type = "robust",
  pmethod = "rao-scott",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object representing a model of the class \code{geer}.}

\item{scope}{a formula giving the terms to be considered for adding or
    dropping.}

\item{test}{character indicating the desired test. Options include the
Wald test (\code{"wald"}), the generalized score test
(\code{"score"}), the modified working Wald test
(\code{"working-wald"}), the modified working score test
(\code{"working-score"}) and the modified working likelihood
ratio test (\code{"working-lrt"}). By default, the
Wald test is performed.}

\item{cov_type}{character indicating the type of the covariance matrix to be
used. Options include the sandwich or robust covariance
matrix (\code{"robust"}), the bias-corrected covariance
matrix (\code{"bias-corrected"}), the degrees of freedom adjusted
covariance matrix (\code{"df-adjusted"}) and the model-based or naive
covariance matrix (\code{"naive"}). By default, the robust covariance
matrix is used.}

\item{pmethod}{character indicating the method used to approximate the p-value
when the modified working Wald test, the modified working score test or
the modified working likelihood ratio test is used. Options include the
Rao-Scott approximation (\code{"rao-scott"}) and the Satterthwaite
approximation (\code{"Satterthwaite"}). By default, the Rao-Scott
approximation is used.}

\item{...}{additional objects representing models of the same class \code{geer}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{anova} summarizing the differences in fit between the models.
}
\description{
Compute all the single terms in the \code{scope} argument that can be added
to or dropped from the model, fit those models and compute a table of the
changes in fit.
}
\details{
For \code{drop1}, a missing scope is taken to be all terms in the model. The
hierarchy is respected when considering terms to be added or dropped:
all main effects contained in a second-order interaction must remain, and so on.

In a scope formula . means ‘what is already there’.

The output table also gives CIC.
