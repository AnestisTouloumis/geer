\title{Add or Drop All Possible Single Terms to a Model from a \code{geer} Object}

\method{add1}{geer}(
  object,
  scope,

\arguments{
\item{object}{an object representing a model of the class \code{geer}.}

\item{scope}{a formula giving the terms to be considered for adding or
    dropping.}

\item{test}{character indicating the hypothesis testing procedure. Options
include the Wald test (\code{"wald"}), the generalized score test
(\code{"score"}), the modified working Wald test
(\code{"working-wald"}), the modified working score test
(\code{"working-score"}) and the modified working likelihood ratio
test (\code{"working-lrt"}). By default, the Wald test is performed.}

\item{cov_type}{character indicating the type of the covariance matrix to be
used in the testing procedure. Options include the sandwich or robust
covariance matrix (\code{"robust"}), the bias-corrected covariance
matrix (\code{"bias-corrected"}), the degrees of freedom adjusted
covariance matrix (\code{"df-adjusted"}) and the model-based or naive
covariance matrix (\code{"naive"}). By default, the robust covariance
matrix is used.}

\item{pmethod}{character indicating the method used to approximate the p-value
when the modified working Wald test, the modified working score test or
the modified working likelihood ratio test is selected. Options include
the Rao-Scott approximation (\code{"rao-scott"}) and the Satterthwaite
approximation (\code{"Satterthwaite"}). By default, the Rao-Scott
approximation is used.}

\item{...}{additional argument(s) for methods.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"anova"} summarizing the differences in fit
  between the models.
}
\description{
Compute all the single terms in the \code{scope} argument that can be
  added to or dropped from the model, fit those models and compute a
  table of the changes in fit.
}
\details{
For \code{drop1}, a missing scope is taken to be all terms in the model. The
hierarchy is respected when considering terms to be added or dropped:
all main effects contained in a second-order interaction must remain, and so
on.

In a scope formula . means 'what is already there'.

Details about the hypothesis testing procedures implied by \code{test} can
be found in \cite{Rotnitzky and Jewell (1990)}. Note that
\code{test = "working-lrt"} is only available to fitted models with an
independence working association structure. Otherwise, an error message is
returned.

When \code{test = "wald"} or \code{test = "score"}, the \code{p_method}
argument is ignored and \code{cov_type} specifies the covariance matrix
estimate used to calculate the corresponding test statistic. Otherwise,
\code{cov_type} specifies the covariance matrix estimate used to calculate
the coefficients of the sum of independent chi-squared random variables, and
\code{p_method} argument specifies the approximation method used to calculate
the p-value of the resulting test statistic.

The output table also gives the Correlation Information Criterion (CIC)
criterion.
