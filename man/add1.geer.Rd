\title{Add or Drop All Possible Single Terms to a Model}
\usage{
\method{add1}{geer}(object, scope, test = "wald", cov_type = "robust", ...)

\method{drop1}{geer}(object, scope, test = "wald", cov_type = "robust", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a model fit of class \code{"geer"}.}

\item{scope}{a formula giving the terms to be considered for adding or
dropping.}

\item{test}{character indicating the hypothesis testing procedure applied.
Options include \code{wald} or \code{score} test.  By
default, the wald test is used.}

\item{cov_type}{character indicating whether the sandwich (robust)
covariance
matrix (\code{cov_type = "robust"}), the model-based (naive) covariance
matrix (\code{cov_type = "naive"}), the bias-corrected covariance
matrix (\code{cov_type = "bias-corrected"}) or the degrees of freedom adjusted
covariance matrix (\code{cov_type = "df-adjusted"}) should be used. By
default, the robust covariance matrix is used.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\description{
Compute all the single terms in the scope argument that can be added to or
dropped from the model, fit those models and compute a table of the changes
in fit.
}
\details{
For \code{drop1}, a missing scope is taken to be all terms in the model. The
hierarchy is respected when considering terms to be added or dropped:
all main effects contained in a second-order interaction must remain, and so on.

In a scope formula . means ‘what is already there’.
